Navigate to GROUP-PROJECT/src/dist/passwordManager after installing the program and run the passwordManager.exe file inside. For quick access you may want to create a desktop shortcut to the exe file. There are four windows within the program. The login window, the main menu, the add password window, and the password manager window. The login window is where it is possible to create new users and login if an account is already created. The main menu allows navigation to the other windows. The add password window allows you to add new passwords to the password manager. The Password manager allows you to view, copy, and remove passwords saved in the password manager. To copy a password click the desired password and hit ctrl+c. To remove a password click on it and hit the remove button.
